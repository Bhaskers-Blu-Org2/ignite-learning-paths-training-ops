# OPS20 (Tailwind Traders AKS Deployment)

## Prerequisites

To present **OPS20 - Responding to Incidents**, you'll need an account with the following services.

- Microsoft Azure
- Microsoft Teams

### Azure Subscription

If you are presenting the demonstrations live you will need to access the Azure Portal, which requires an Azure account. If you have not done so already, [sign up for free here](https://portal.azure.com).

### Microsoft Teams

You will also be demonstrating functionality from within Microsoft Teams. If you do not have an account, [sign up for one here](https://teams.microsoft.com/start).

### Postman

To send an alert to the Logic App used in Demo 1, requires sending a JSON payload to a URL. This is accomplished easily using the Postman tool.[ Windows and Mac versions are both avaiable](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).

This or similar tool is recommended for the first demonstration.

## Post-Deployment Steps

Once the Tailwind Traders demo environment has finished deploying, return here and [follow the instructions found in the post-deployment.md](/ops20/deployment/post-deployment.md).

## **IMPORTANT:** When you are done with the demo and presentation

Be sure to delete the resources when you have completed the presentation.

Run the following command from [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to delete the entire resource group.

``` az cli
az group delete --name <resource group name> --yes --no-wait
```

It will take several minutes, but by deleting the entire resource group, all resources associated with the demo environment will be destroyed.

## Having Trouble?

### Provider registration

The Tailwind Traders application uses many Azure services. In some cases, if a service has not yet been used in your subscription, a provider registration may be needed. The following commands will ensure your subscription is capable of running the Tailwind Traders application.

``` az cli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DocumentDB
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationsManagement
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Sql
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
```
