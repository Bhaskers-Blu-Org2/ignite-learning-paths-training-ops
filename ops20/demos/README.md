# Technical Demonstrations

## [Demo 1: Creating An Incident Response Plan](01/README.md)

**What are we trying to demonstrate?**

This is the first on-stage technical demonstration for the presentation.

In it, we want to help the audience connect principles and practices of modern incident management (discussed in [Section 1 of the presentation](../slides/section/01/README.md)) with concrete "hands on" examples.

This demo uses the following:

- Logic App
- Azure Boards
- Microsoft Teams

---

## [Demo 2: Troubleshooting Guides & Status Page](02/README.md)

**What are we trying to demonstrate?**

In this demonstration we want to highlight how Troubleshooting Guides can be customized in a way that they can be very useful in the early phases of response and remediation.

Additionally, we want to highlight the importance of sharing what information we have with a broader stakeholder audience. We should make clear and transparent communication of information a priority.

This demo uses the following:

- Troubleshooting Guide
- Microsoft Teams
- Azure Functions (Serverless)

---

## [Demo 3: Remediation of Shopping Cart](03/README.md)

**What are we trying to demonstrate?**

We are demonstrating several tools within the Azure ecosystem that can help reduce the time to recover from a service disruption.

This demo touches on six (6) unique products within the Azure ecosystem we will use to "respond" & "remediate" an active "incident".

We will navigate through a number of tools beginning with the Application Dashboard.

This demo uses the following:

- Azure Dashboard
- Azure Service Health
- Application Map
- Azure Workbook
- Log Analytics
- KQL
